# Analyze-Data-Using-R-and-Power-BI

Aim: To Analyse the performance of Hollywood movies.

Data : Title, genre, studio, profitability and ratings for movies released 2007-2012. 
Source: https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/data/,  https://public.tableau.com/app/resources/sample-data

Here I used raw data set listing the top hollywoods most profitable stories.As the given data is inconsistent, I'm using R(postIt Cloud) to analyze and cleanze the data.
While analyzing I checked for duplicates, missing values and outliers.

VISUAL REPRESENTATION USING POWER BI:
After extracting the clean data from R, I have used Power BI tool for visual representation of data.
So our main aim as per client request are to find:

• The average ratings of each genre 
• The number of movies produced per year 
• The audience scores for each film
• The profitability per studio 
• The worldwide gross per genre

Specifications: For the dashboard, the company would like you to use their brand colors which are blue, green and brown. You can use light or dark shades of each color. For example, light blue and dark blue are acceptable.
