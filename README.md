# Analyze-Data-Using-R-and-Power-BI

Aim: To Analyse the performance of Hollywood movies.

Data : Title, genre, studio, profitability and ratings for movies released 2007-2012. Source: https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/data/

Here I used raw data set listing the top hollywoods most profitable stories.As the given data is inconsistent, I'm using R(postIt Cloud) to analyze and cleanze the data.
While analyzing I checked for duplicates, missing values and outliers. Attaching the R script below for reference.

VISUAL REPRESENTATION USING POWER BI:
After extracting the clean data from R, I have used Power BI tool for visual representation of data.
So our main aim as per client request are to find:

• The average ratings of each genre 
• The number of movies produced per year 
• The audience scores for each film
• The profitability per studio 
• The worldwide gross per genre
